LEGIT v1.31 (Release date: 2019-08-29)
==============

Changes:

* Automatically makes classification=TRUE when using criterion="cv_AUC" in certain functions that have it as argument
* Added function to transforms a LEGIT model into a IMLEGIT model (and vice-versa).
* removed the annoying printing when pROC is called (which meant a lot of annoyance when using "cv_AUC")
* fixed minor bugs

LEGIT v1.3 (Release date: 2019-07-16)
==============

Changes:

* Added Elastic Net variable selection. This is much faster and better than other methods.

LEGIT v1.2.1 (Release date: 2018-02-07)
==============

Changes:

* Documentation fixes
* Bug with missing data in LEGIT fixed
* Model fits of GxE testing are now ordered from best to worse
* Added Plot.LEGIT option to change label
* Changed rescale option in LEGIT to use the range [-1,1] rather than [0,1]. Why? Because if you had negative weights, the score variable was not garanteed to be in [0,1] but with [-1,1], it always is going to be in [-1,1].
* Updated vignettes
* Small other fixes
